# Instructions:
# The components of the password are represented in the form of arrays.
# Use the random method to select at least one character from each array of characters.
# Since the 12-character password is required, so fill the rest of the length of the password left with randomly selected
# characters from an array formed from the combination of all the characters needed in the final password. Anytime the password is generated,
# shuffle the password using random.shuffle() to ensure that the final password does not follow a particular patter
